# [Charting Relationship - Homes Before 1980]

Below, I created 2 charts to evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980. This will help determine from the different features, to predict a home that was built before or after 1980.  

```{python}

# Chart 1
h_subset = dwellings_ml.filter(['livearea', 'finbsmnt', 
    'basement', 'yearbuilt', 'nocars', 'numbdrm', 'numbaths', 
    'stories', 'yrbuilt', 'before1980']).sample(500)

sns.pairplot(h_subset, hue = 'before1980')


```



### [Number Bedrooms - Year Built]

Based on these observations, a machine learning algorithm could use the number of bedrooms and the year built as features to predict the price of a house. The algorithm could also use the binary feature indicating whether the house was built before or after 1980 as a categorical feature to improve its prediction accuracy.

```{python}
#| label: Q1
# Chart 1

# The given code generates a scatter plot using the Altair library in Python. The plot shows the relationship between the number of bedrooms and the year built for a subset of housing data. The x-axis represents the number of bedrooms, and the y-axis represents the year built. The points on the plot represent individual houses, and the color of each point indicates whether the house was built before or after 1980.

(alt.Chart(h_subset)
.mark_point() 
.encode(
    x=alt.X('numbdrm'),
    y=alt.Y('yrbuilt', axis=alt.Axis(format=".0f"), scale=alt.Scale(domain=[1880, 2200])),
    color = 'before1980:N'
)
)



```

### [Number Baths - Year Built]

Based on these observations, a machine learning algorithm could use the number of baths and the year built as features to predict the house was built before or after 1980 as a categorical feature to improve its prediction accuracy.


```{python}
# Chart 2
# The plot shows the relationship between the number of baths and the year built for a subset of housing data. The x-axis represents the number of baths, and the y-axis represents the year built. The points on the plot represent individual houses, and the color of each point indicates whether the house was built before or after 1980.

(alt.Chart(h_subset)
.mark_point() 
.encode(
    x=alt.X('numbaths'),
    y=alt.Y('yrbuilt', axis=alt.Axis(format=".0f"), scale=alt.Scale(domain=[1880, 2200])),
    color = 'before1980:N'
)
)
