# [Charting Relationship - Homes Before 1980]

Below, I created 2 charts to evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980. This will help determine from the different features, to predict a home that was built before or after 1980.  

```{python}
h_subset = dwellings_ml.filter(['livearea', 'finbsmnt', 
    'basement', 'yearbuilt', 'nocars', 'numbdrm', 'numbaths', 
    'stories', 'yrbuilt', 'before1980']).sample(500)

sns.pairplot(h_subset, hue = 'before1980')


```



### [Number Bedrooms - Year Built]

Based on these observations, a machine learning algorithm could use the number of bedrooms and the year built as features to predict the price of a house. The algorithm could also use the binary feature indicating whether the house was built before or after 1980 as a categorical feature to improve its prediction accuracy.

```{python}
#| label: Q1
# Chart 1

# The given code generates a scatter plot using the Altair library in Python. The plot shows the relationship between the number of bedrooms and the year built for a subset of housing data. The x-axis represents the number of bedrooms, and the y-axis represents the year built. The points on the plot represent individual houses, and the color of each point indicates whether the house was built before or after 1980.

(alt.Chart(h_subset)
.mark_point() 
.encode(
    x=alt.X('numbdrm'),
    y=alt.Y('yrbuilt', axis=alt.Axis(format=".0f"), scale=alt.Scale(domain=[1880, 2200])),
    color = 'before1980:N'
)
)



```

### [Number Baths - Year Built]

Based on these observations, a machine learning algorithm could use the number of baths and the year built as features to predict the house was built before or after 1980 as a categorical feature to improve its prediction accuracy.


```{python}
# Chart 2
# The plot shows the relationship between the number of baths and the year built for a subset of housing data. The x-axis represents the number of baths, and the y-axis represents the year built. The points on the plot represent individual houses, and the color of each point indicates whether the house was built before or after 1980.

(alt.Chart(h_subset)
.mark_point() 
.encode(
    x=alt.X('numbaths'),
    y=alt.Y('yrbuilt', axis=alt.Axis(format=".0f"), scale=alt.Scale(domain=[1880, 2200])),
    color = 'before1980:N'
)
)


```







## [Classification Model - Homes before 1980]

The following is a classification model for labeled houses built "before 1980" or "during or after 1980". The accuracy scored here on this model is:  91% . The model choice presented is a decision tree due to helpful evalutation of options. The decision tree helped with possible outcomes of choosing which options it might be. The parameters used in this test were filterd out with the "yrbuilt", "parcel", "before1980" - model will truly predict if a home is built before 1980. 
```{python}
#| label: Q2

#
# Separate the features (X) and targets (Y)
x = dwellings_ml.drop(["yrbuilt", "parcel", "before1980"],axis=1)
y = dwellings_ml[["before1980"]]

# adding on the neighborhood data
#x2 = x.join(dwellings_neighborhoods, how='left')



# Split the data into train and test sets
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.20, random_state=0)

#
# Create a decision tree
classifier_DT = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = 11)

# Fit the decision tree
classifier_DT.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Test the decision tree (make predictions)
y_predicted_DT = classifier_DT.predict(x_test)

# Evaluate the decision tree
print("Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_predicted_DT))

```



## [Plotting Feature Importance]

Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model. This discussion should include a chart and a description of the features.

```{python}
#| label: Q3

classifier_DT.feature_importances_
feature_df = pd.DataFrame({'features':x.columns, 'importance':classifier_DT.feature_importances_})
print(feature_df)
