## Elevator pitch

I did the reading and rendered a chart and table.


__Highlight the grand questions__

## GRAND QUESTION 1

Finish the readings and be prepared with any questions to get your environment working smoothly (class for on-campus and Slack for online)


```{python}
#| label: GQ1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here


```


## GRAND QUESTION 2

In VS Code, write a python script to create the example Altair chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook (part of the assigned readings). Note that you have to type chart to see the Altair chart after you create it.

Here's the chart.

```{python}
#| label: GQ2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here

import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

alt.data_transformers.enable('json')
#> DataTransformerRegistry.enable('json')

url = "https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/raw/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv"
mpg = pd.read_csv(url)


chart = (alt.Chart(mpg)
  .encode(
    x='displ',
    y='hwy')
  .mark_circle()
)

chart

```





## GRAND QUESTION 3

Your final report should also include the markdown table created from the following (assuming you have mpg from question 2).




| manufacturer   | model   |   year |   hwy |
|:---------------|:--------|-------:|------:|
| audi           | a4      |   1999 |    29 |
| audi           | a4      |   1999 |    29 |
| audi           | a4      |   2008 |    31 |
| audi           | a4      |   2008 |    30 |
| audi           | a4      |   1999 |    26 |
