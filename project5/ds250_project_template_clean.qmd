## Data

Importing Star Wars Data

```{python}
#| label: project data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
# Include and execute your code here
dat = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/star-wars-survey/StarWars.csv",encoding= 'unicode_escape', skiprows=2, header=None)
```


## Background

In 2014, FiveThirtyEight surveyed over 1000 people to write the article titled, America’s Favorite ‘Star Wars’ Movies (And Least Favorite Characters). They have provided the data on GitHub.

For this project, use the Star Wars survey data to figure out if they can predict an interviewing job candidate’s current income based on a few responses about Star Wars movies.



## [New Table Names]

Shorten the column names and clean them up for easier use with pandas. Provide a table or list that exemplifies how you fixed the names.

- skipped the first two rows, and set the header to None value, the default it now 0 to 37. 
- len(dat.columns) to see the length of the number or columns
- info(verbose=True) to list all the names of the columns
- iloc[:,6] check the information of all column 6

```{python}
#| label: GQ1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here



dat = (dat.rename(columns={
  0: "response_id", 1: "seen_six", 2: "fan_starwars", 3: "seen_movie_one", 
  4: "seen_movie_two", 5: "seen_movie_three", 6: "seen_movie_four", 7: "seen_movie_five", 
  8: "seen_movie_six", 9: "rank_movie_one", 10: "rank_movie_two", 11: "rank_movie_three", 
  12: "rank_movie_four", 13: "rank_movie_five", 14: "rank_movie_six", 15: "rate_han", 
  16: "rate_luke", 17: "rate_lei", 18: "rate_anakin", 19: "rate_obi", 
  20: "rate_palpatine", 21: "rate_vadar", 22: "rate_lando", 23: "rate_boba", 
  24: "rate_c-3P0", 25: "rate_r2", 26: "rate_jar", 27: "rate_padme", 
  28: "rate_yoda", 29: "character_shot", 30: "familiar_eu", 31: "fan_eu", 
  32: "fan_startrek", 33: "gender", 34: "age", 35: "h_income", 
  36: "education", 37: "location"}
  ))

```



## GRAND QUESTION 2

Clean and format the data so that it can be used in a machine learning model. As you format the data, you should complete each item listed below. In your final report provide example(s) of the reformatted data with a short description of the changes made.

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: GQ2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here


```



Filter the dataset to respondents that have seen at least one film.
```{python}
#| label: GQ2 chart

```



Create a new column that converts the age ranges to a single number. Drop the age range categorical column.
```{python}
#| label: GQ2 table

```



Create a new column that converts the education groupings to a single number. Drop the school categorical column
```{python}
#| label: GQ2 table

```



Create a new column that converts the income ranges to a single number. Drop the income range categorical column.
```{python}
#| label: GQ2 table

```



Create your target (also known as “y” or “label”) column based on the new income range column.
```{python}
#| label: GQ2 table

```




One-hot encode all remaining categorical columns.
```{python}
#| label: GQ2 table

```




## GRAND QUESTION 3

Validate that the data provided on GitHub lines up with the article by recreating 2 of the visuals from the article.

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: GQ3
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here


```




## Grand Question 4

Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person makes more than $50k. Describe your model and report the accuracy.

```{python}
#| label: GQ4
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
```
